4.0
 Genuine Pandora - took a lot of close inspection but eventually found the 925 ALE hallmark (almost invisible). Fits the leather type bracelets reasonably well. One star off for poor packaging - it came completely loose (no other materials whatsoever) in a standard amazon DVD/book style cardboard package.
