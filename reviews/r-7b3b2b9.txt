 The charm itself was good, smaller than expected however. Theproblem was that it came only in a small clear plastic bag, how can i give tis as a lresent? I had to buy s new charm from Argento (i would recommend) which was only 4 quid more, save yourself 16 quid and a lot of messing about and dint bother with this.
