 3 words - DO NOT BOTHER!! Recevied this in the post, was first of all shocked at how bad this was packaged. Very badly stapled accross the top of the padded envelope of which i had no option to open accross from this as had no idea where the charm was in the envelope, staight away cut my finger on one of the staples. NOT HAPPY! I On finally managing to get in the envelope found the charm wrapped in a little plastic bag, once again stapled up. straight away you can tell the charm was fake from the weight of it, on further inspection you can see all the flaws and inperfections and tackiness of the charm. Pandora pride themselves on all their charms being handmade so there are no flaws or inperfections, all the charms should be should be smooth and lines perfect. On the booble part round around the charm this was just flat where you can tell someone has probably made some attempt at trying to put a stamp on it. THERE IS NO 925 ALE STAMP ON THE CHARM. Also Pandora charms screw on, this is far too big and slides on. I have contacted Amazon and have been informed by the seller 'My Piercing' to post this back to Thailand by non tracked post. . Extremley unhappy as i am in a Christmas club throughout the year and buy Amazon vouchers to purchase presents, I ended up at the Pandora shop buying a charm as a gift. This year will just be saving the money instead and buying direct from the shops.
