 I ordered this item for a Christmas present for my mum. She recently received a Pandora bracelet for her 50th and is after beads for it for Christmas. I had seen this exact bead on the official Pandora website earlier in the week for £20. Although this bead does not come in a box, the £4 saving is worth it. I have a few spare boxes which I can use to give this as a gift so the fact it didn't come with a box wasn't an issue for me. However, if you are buying as a gift, I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a box handy or are able to buy one. The bead itself is lovely, and is genuine (believe me, I have checked!) My bead arrived in a small plastic envelope, although others who have reviewed seem to have received theirs differently. Some in boxes, despite the advert stating no box, and others in nice Pandora gift bags. All in all, I am happy with this purchase.
