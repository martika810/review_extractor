 This is cute if you like hearts done in a sophisticated way. It is a good size and looks good on the bracelet. If you buy this in a Pandora store it is £20 with the Pandora box and ribbon and bag. Amazon do not supply any of those, it comes in a small clear plastic bag and that is why they can offer that £5.00 discount to the customer. If this is a gift for someone special then it is worth paying the extra £5.00 to give it the extra special treatment.
