 i have one of these beads already and ordered this one for my daughter. when it arrived although not in boxed packaging it was identicle in every way as the one i already owned. someone previously complained that the bead was not stamped nor had a screw fitting inside and said it was fake!!... well neither did the one i bought from the official pandora shop an this one is exactly the same so i do believe they are pandora and im a happy customer... besides you dont wear the packaging now do you ??
