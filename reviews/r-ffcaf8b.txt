 I wanted a nice wee gift for my sister who lives 300 miles away and as we bought her a pandora bracelet 2 years ago and I wanted something that would fit in her letterbox I searched the extensive range at Pandora found one in the price range I was thinking of and had it delivered to her door on time and just what I wanted.
