 I have given this a 3 only because you can not give it 2 and 1/2. and the fact that I can not be asked to return it, and that I am not using it as a feature charm more of a spacer. It is poorly,marked but it is there. every feature of this charm is cheap, the feel and the weight, would not have purchased this from a store. Having said it is cheap, and does only look cheap on close inspection. This not the sellers fault it is the product. How ever as a gift and this is at the level you have to spend inc delivery go for it, but can not recommend it.
