 I bought this little Charm for my Wife for St Valentines Day, lovely little bead with very intricate working on it. My Wife loves it. I'm a little suspicious whether it is genuine or not as I thought there might have been a marking to say that it was Sterling Silver and also the Pandora name somehow inscribed on it, still if my Wife likes it then why should I worry.
