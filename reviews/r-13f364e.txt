 I bought this charm as a birthday present for my sister. Not only did the charm arrived before the expected delivery date, the charm also arrived in a nice Pandora box. I also liked the fact that the delivery was free. My sister requested that I only buy her a charm that's within the Â£20 range. I wasn't willing to go into a Pandora shop and only purchased one charm as I thought it might seem pathetic. Thank you
