 I had to return mine as i checked with Pandora and they said it was a fake. They never sell through other companies unless officially verified and never online. The inside of the bead should have a black patina (colour which is natural with silver). Pandora never sell anything with out the official box etc... By the time you have bought this bead and the box you have paid for the real thing. Be very wary.
