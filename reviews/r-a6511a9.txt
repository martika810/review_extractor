3.0
 I already have this of my own from a Pandora store, and I bought this for a gift. It's a different size and looks a brighter silver than mine which concerns me as fake silver is often shinier, as well as being slightly longer than mine. I only bought from here as it's easier to have something delivered than to go out, but for those who can get out, spend a few extra Â£'s and get something real, because I'm quite convinced it isn't real. However if you're not worried about authenticity, it's a half decent second best.
